<h4>OVERVIEW OF MODULE 
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________
This module consisted of 3 main components:
<br>
<br>1) We first created a list of random 1000 longitudes and latitudes. we then used an weather API to extract relevant information from a JSON file about these locations </br>
<br>2) The second part of the assignment consisting of using a Google Maps API to plot the locations' on a heat-map and figure out the closest hotel for each of the locations </br>
<br>3) The thirds part consisted of get user input as to what temperature they'd prefer when going on vacation and then filtering all our indexed locations to find suitable hotels. We then created an itinerary as a map showing how to get form one place to another in case the user wanted to visit multiple locations
